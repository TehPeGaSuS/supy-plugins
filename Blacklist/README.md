A nifty channel ban plugin.

Written especially for me, by a a username named Kaya on IRC.

Banmask types:
```
0: '*!ident@host',
1: '*!*ident@host',
2: '*!*@host',
3: '*!*ident@*.phost',
4: '*!*@*.phost',
5: 'nick!ident@host',
6: 'nick!*ident@host',
7: 'nick!*@host',
8: 'nick!*ident@*.phost',
9: 'nick!*@*.phost',
10: '*!ident@*'
```
Note: I'm having some issues with the `phost` masks where a `p` is added to the mask. I'll ask for a fix if I see the user again. (This is probably fixed with commit 1804a3d)
